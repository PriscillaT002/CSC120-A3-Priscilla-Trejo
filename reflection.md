On this assignment I worked with Lily G., Juniper H., and Lesly H. . I went to the night session of TA hours to get my JAVA debugger working. My initial impression of JAVA is that it is more difficult than PYTHON and requires more planning out before coding. I feel like I will have to look online for more teaching resources that'll help me feel more comfortable with Java and break out of coding habits I have from python. Both languages are supposedly easy to learn and are considered introdcutory languages. However, python is an interpreted language and java is a compiled langauage, making Java a bit faster. I have concluded that both languages have their advantages and disadvantages and that it is useful to know how to work in both. Although one may seem a bit easier to code with they will both come in handy for future projects. Consulting with other students helped because we were able to each take on the problem and reason with reachother on why a certain solution would work or not. Its still intimidating to work on these homeworks but I'm hoping I'll be less scared of our assignments as we progress nto the semester.
